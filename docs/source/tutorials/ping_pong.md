# Ping Pong



This tutorial will showcase the following notions:

- Smart-contract deployment
- Smart-contract queries
- Smart-contract calls

The entire source code can be find in the MxOps [github](https://github.com/Catenscia/MxOps/tree/main/examples)

## Context

We will write MxOps scenes to deploy and interact with the ping-pong contract from the [MultiversX tutorial](https://docs.multiversx.com/developers/tutorials/your-first-dapp).

Here is the plan:

- Deploy the ping-pong contract
- Ping some eGLD to the contract
- Pong the eGLD back

Nothing fancy there, but this will teach you the strings of MxOps and you will get familiar with this tool üòÑ

## Prerequisites

You will need to have the following installed:

- MxOps: [installation steps](../getting_started/introduction)
- Rust and sc-meta: [installation steps](https://docs.multiversx.com/sdk-and-tools/troubleshooting/rust-setup/#installing-rust-and-sc-meta)
- Git: [installation steps](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Tutorial plan

1. Clone the ping-pong contract and build it
2. Setup your devnet wallet
3. Deploy the contract
4. Ping
5. Pong
6. Executions

To prepare for the tutorial, create a new folder

```bash
mkdir ping_pong_tutorial
cd ping_pong_tutorial
```

## Smart Contract Build

To deploy the ping-pong smart-contract, we need it in wasm format.
Let's retrieve from Github the source code of the ping-pong contract and compile it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/multiversx/mx-ping-pong-sc contract
sc-meta all build
```

Make sure that the last lines of the output are like this:

```bash
Packing ../output/ping-pong.mxsc.json ...
Contract size: 3799 bytes.  # size maybe a bit different depending on the version
```

The contract is now compiled and ready to be deployed! üì°

## Owner Wallet

We will need a wallet to make our tests. The easiest is to use a pem wallet, as it doesn't require a confirmation when signing transactions.

Create a folder for the mxops scenes and create a setup scene:

```bash
mkdir mxops_scenes
touch mxops_scenes/account_setup.yaml
```

In the scene `mxops_scenes/account_setup.yaml`, add the following:


```yaml
steps:

  - type: GenerateWallets
    save_folder: ./wallets
    wallets:
        - owner
  
  - type: R3D4Faucet
    targets:
      - owner
```

This will create a pem wallet at `wallets/owner.pem` and ask the [r3d4](https://r3d4.fr/faucet) faucet for some initial funds. 
You can execute this scene on devnet with the command below:

```bash
mxops execute -n devnet -s ping_pong_tutorial mxops_scenes/account_setup.yaml
```

```

```{note}
The r3d4 faucet is heavily used, so it may be empty when you try to claim some EGLD.
In this situation, MxOps will give you the following error:
mxops.errors.FaucetFailed: Balance is too low. Try again later
```

The funds should arrive under a minute but if there is any error, you can manually ask for some funds on the regular faucet on the [devnet wallet](https://devnet-wallet.multiversx.com)

```{warning}
The secret key of the wallet is written in clear in a pem file! It is very useful for tests but unless you know what you are doing, don't use pem files for mainnet.
```

## Deployment

Everything is in place for us to deploy our ping-pong contract so let's get to work ‚öíÔ∏èüë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

To deploy our contract, we will use a `ContractDeploy` step while specifying several elements: the path of the wasm file, the wallet that will deploy the contract, the code metadata and lastly the arguments for the initialization of our contract.

The `init` function of the `ping-pong` contract take three arguments:

```rust
#[init]
fn init(
    &self,
    ping_amount: BigUint,
    duration_in_seconds: u64,
    opt_token_id: OptionalValue<EgldOrEsdtTokenIdentifier>,
)
```

We don't want yet to specify the ping amount or the wait time between the ping and the pong transactions. So we will use environment variables (`PING_PONG_AMOUNT` and `PONG_WAIT_TIME`), which will allow us specify it at deployment time.


To be able to interact with the deployed contract later on in the scene, we need give the newly deployed contract an id.  We will choose `egld-ping-pong` for our tutorial.

Create the file `mxops_scenes\01_deploy.yaml` and write the content below 

```yaml
steps:

  - type: ContractDeploy
    sender: owner
    wasm_path: "./contract/ping-pong/output/ping-pong.wasm"
    abi_path: "./contract/ping-pong/output/ping-pong.abi.json"
    contract_id: "egld-ping-pong"
    gas_limit: 40000000
    arguments:
      - "$PING_PONG_AMOUNT"
      - "$PONG_WAIT_TIME"
      - null
    upgradeable: true
    readable: false
    payable: false
    payable_by_sc: true
```

We provide a `null` value for the optional token identifier, this will make the contract select EGLD by default.

```{note}
To tell MxOps that `PING_PONG_AMOUNT` and `PONG_WAIT_TIME` are environment variables, we use the `$` symbol. Find more about this in the [smart-values chapter](../user_documentation/values).
```

## Ping

Let's say we want to ping our contract, but we don't remember what was the ping amount to send. So what we will do is first ask the contract for the amount of EGLD we are supposed to send and then send the ping transaction with the correct amount.

Create a new scene, which we will call `mxops_scenes\02_ping.yaml`:

```yaml
steps:

  - type: ContractQuery
    contract: "egld-ping-pong"
    endpoint: getPingAmount
    results_save_keys:
      - PingAmount

  - type: ContractCall
    sender: owner
    contract: "egld-ping-pong"
    endpoint: ping
    gas_limit: 3000000
    value: "%egld-ping-pong.PingAmount"
    checks:
      - type: Success

      - type: Transfers
        condition: exact
        expected_transfers:
          - sender: "%owner.address"
            receiver: "%egld-ping-pong.address"
            identifier: EGLD
            amount: "%egld-ping-pong.PingAmount"

```

Some explanations:

- The first step tells MxOps to make a query to our contract, retrieve the ping amount and save it under the key `egld-ping-pong.PingAmount`
- The second step tells MxOps to execute the ping transaction while sending the current amount of EGLD, this amount is referenced using the [smart-values](../user_documentation/values) system of MxOps: `%egld-ping-pong.PingAmount`
- Lastly, to make sure that everything went alright, we will ask to MxOps to check two things: first that the transaction is a success (which he does by default) and second that the transaction contains exactly the expected transfer of EGLD from us to the ping pong contract

## Pong

As we set a wait time of 1 second and a block confirmation time is more than that, we can call the "pong" endpoint immediately after the ping confirmation. Indeed by default, MxOps wait for each transaction to be confirmed before sending the next one.
As MultiversX block are 6 seconds long, the wait period for the pong action will be over.

Create the scene `mxops_scenes/03_pong.yaml` and add the content that is very similar to the ping scene:

```yaml
steps:

  - type: ContractCall
    sender: owner
    contract: "egld-ping-pong"
    endpoint: pong
    gas_limit: 3000000
    checks:
      - type: Success

      - type: Transfers
        condition: exact
        expected_transfers:
          - sender: "%egld-ping-pong.address"
            receiver: "%owner.address"
            identifier: EGLD
            amount: "%egld-ping-pong.PingAmount"

```

Here, we will check that the contract indeed send us back the correct amount of EGLD.

## Executions

The only thing left to do for us is now to tell MxOps to execute our three scenes: deploy, ping and pong. As we named our scene with numbers (01, 02 and 03), they are already in the correct execution order. So we will just provide to MxOps the folder of the scenes:

```bash
export PING_PONG_AMOUNT=100000000000000000  # 0.1 EGLD
export PONG_WAIT_TIME=1  # 1 seconds
mxops execute -n devnet -s ping_pong_tutorial mxops_scenes
```

```

You should now see MxOps slowly executing the steps, one after the other. It will also give you the explorer links of the transactions so you can inspect the results in more details if you want to.


If you want you can ping again the contract:

```bash
mxops execute -n devnet -s ping_pong_tutorial mxops_scenes/02_ping.yaml
```

and pong it when you feel like it:

```bash
mxops execute -n devnet -s ping_pong_tutorial mxops_scenes/03_pong.yaml
```

## Data

If you want to look at the data saved by MxOps in the `ping_pong_tutorial` [scenario](../user_documentation/scenario), enter the command below:
