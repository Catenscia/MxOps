# Installation

## Dependencies

`MxOps` relies on `mxpy`, the python sdk written by the MultiversX team.
Follow their instructions to [install mxpy](https://docs.multiversx.com/sdk-and-tools/sdk-py/installing-mxpy/).

## From PyPI

MxOps is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mxops/). Install it simply with pip:

```

## From Github

If you want the latest developments of `MxOps`, you can install the package directly from the develop branch:

If you want another branch or version, just replace "develop" by the branch or tag you want.

## Extension

If you use VScode, we recommend you to use the extension `mxopsHelper` which will greatly help you using `MxOps`!
When installing, take a look at the README of the extension for the features that will assist you.
