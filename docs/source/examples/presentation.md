# Presentation

This section will give you examples on how to use MxOps in various ways. Our aim is to showcase as extensively as possible the use cases for this tool. More examples will be provided as time goes by and as more functionalities are added to MxOps.

```{note}
If you a bit curious, you will notice that the examples in this section are in fact the [integration tests](https://github.com/Catenscia/MxOps/tree/main/integration_tests) of MxOps.

Integration tests allow to verify that a software works as intended on complete use cases. They are complementary to unit tests and absolutely needed when dealing with complex external components such as blockchains.
