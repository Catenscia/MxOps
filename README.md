# MxOps

MxOps is a python package created to automate MultiversX smart contracts deployments, calls and queries.
Inspired from DevOps tools, it aims to ease and make reproducible any set of these interactions with smart-contracts.

MxOps aims to be useful in these situations:

- deployment automation
- on-chain integration tests
- contract interaction automation
