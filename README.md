# MxOps

![MxOps full logo](./docs/source/_images/mxops_full_logo.png)


MxOps is a python package created to automate MultiversX transactions: be it smart contracts deployments, calls, queries or just simple transfers. Inspired from DevOps tools and built on top of [mx-sdk-py](https://github.com/multiversx/mx-sdk-py), it aims to ease and make reproducible any interaction with the blockchain.

MxOps targets a broad audience of users and developers, by providing a clear, easy to read and write syntax, even for non technical users.

MxOps aims to be particularely useful in these situations:

- deployment automation
- on-chain integration tests
- contract interaction automation

## Quick Overview

Here are some basic uses cases to illustrate how MxOps works.

### Token Mint

```yaml
accounts:  # define the accounts to use
  - account_id: alice
    pem_path: ./wallets/alice.pem

steps:
  - type: FungibleIssue  # Issue the fungible token
    sender: alice
    token_name: AliceToken
    token_ticker: ATK
    initial_supply: 1000000000  # 1,000,000.000 ATK
    num_decimals: 3
    can_add_special_roles: true

  - type: ManageFungibleTokenRoles  # assign mint and burn roles to alice
    sender: alice
    is_set: true
    token_identifier: "%AliceToken.identifier"
    target: alice
    roles:
      - local_mint
      - local_burn
  
  - type: FungibleMint  # make alice mint some tokens
    sender: alice
    token_identifier: "%AliceToken.identifier"
    amount: 100000000  # 100,000.000 ATK

```

### Query with ABI

```yaml
allowed_networks:
    - mainnet

accounts:
  - account_id: onedex-swap
    address: erd1qqqqqqqqqqqqqpgqqz6vp9y50ep867vnr296mqf3dduh6guvmvlsu3sujc
    abi_path: ./abis/onedex-sc.abi.json

steps:

  - type: ContractQuery
    contract: onedex-swap
    endpoint: viewPair
    arguments:
      - 10  # id of the pair to get the details of
    print_results: true
```

```bash
[
    {
        "pair_id": 10,
        "state": {
            "__discriminant__": 1,
            "__name__": "Active"
        },
        "enabled": true,
        "owner": "erd1rfs4pg224d2wmndmntvu2dhfhesmuda6m502vt5mfctn3wg7tu4sk6rtku",
        "first_token_id": "MPH-f8ea2b",
        "second_token_id": "USDC-c76f1f",
        "lp_token_id": "MPHUSDC-777138",
        "lp_token_decimal": 18,
        "first_token_reserve": 15,
        "second_token_reserve": 2331925,
        "lp_token_supply": 393944771203191982,
        "lp_token_roles_are_set": true
    }
]
```

### Contract Call with Payments

```yaml
steps:
  - type: ContractCall
    sender: thomas
    contract: pair-contract
    endpoint: addLiquidity
    arguments:
      - 984849849765987  # (min amount out for slippage protection)
    esdt_transfers:
      - token_identifier: TOKENA-abcdef
        amount: 894916519846515
        nonce: 0
      - token_identifier: TOKENB-abcdef
