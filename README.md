# MxOps

MxOps is a python package created to automate MultiversX transactions: be it smart contracts deployments, calls, queries or just simple transfers. Inspired from DevOps tools and built on top of [mxpy](https://github.com/multiversx/mx-sdk-py-cli), it aims to ease and make reproducible any set of these interactions with the blockchain.

MxOps aims to be useful in these situations:

- deployment automation
- on-chain integration tests
- contract interaction automation

For a quick overview, here's how to create a token, assign a mint role and mint tokens with MxOps:

```yaml
allowed_networks:
  - devnet
  - localnet

allowed_scenario:
  - "alice_mint"

accounts:
  - account_name: alice
    pem_path: ./wallets/alice.pem

steps:
  - type: FungibleIssue
    sender: alice
    token_name: AliceToken
    token_ticker: ATK
    initial_supply: 1000000000  # 1,000,000.000 ATK
    num_decimals: 3
    can_add_special_roles: true

  - type: ManageFungibleTokenRoles
    sender: alice
    is_set: true    # if we want to set or unset the roles below
    token_identifier: "%AliceToken.identifier"
    target: alice
    roles:
      - ESDTRoleLocalMint
      - ESDTRoleLocalBurn
  
  - type: FungibleMint
    sender: alice
    token_identifier: "%AliceToken.identifier"
    amount: 100000000  # 100,000.000 ATK

```

## Contribution

This tool is an humble proposal by [Catenscia](https://catenscia.com/) to have a standard way of writing deployment files, integration tests and others.
